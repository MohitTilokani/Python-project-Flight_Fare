# Python-project-Flight_Fare
Machine learning techniques are used in this research to anticipate aircraft ticket costs.
It predicts the fare by analyzing criteria such as airline, source, destination, date, and duration.

### Tools & Technologies Used in This Project:
1. Python: Used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
2. Pandas: To load, clean, and analyze the flight fare dataset.
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing insights using charts and graphs.
4. NumPy: For numerical computations and handling missing data.
5. Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and data analysis.
6. Excel: As a data source, providing structured flight fare information.

## Conclusion of the Flight Fare Analysis Project

#### Airline Pricing Strategies:
Premium airlines like Jet Airways Business have significantly higher fares (₹58,359 on average), while budget airlines like Trujet and SpiceJet offer the most affordable options (₹4,140 to ₹4,338).
Jet Airways and Air India dominate the market in terms of flights and mid-range fares.

#### Impact of Stops on Pricing:
Direct flights are costlier, but they save time.
More than 52% of flights have one stop, balancing affordability and travel duration.

#### Popular Routes & Airports:
Delhi (42.47%) and Cochin (42.47%) are the busiest source and destination airports.
High flight frequency on major routes results in competitive pricing.

#### Booking Trends & Fare Variability:
Flight prices are highly dynamic, influenced by factors like seasonality, airline demand, and seat availability.
Nearly 78% of flights lack additional information about special services like meals and baggage policies, affecting the transparency of pricing.

#### Key Takeaways for Travelers & Airlines:
Travelers: Booking flights early and opting for indirect routes can help save costs.
Airlines: Offering dynamic pricing strategies and improving fare transparency can boost customer trust.

### Final Thoughts:
This analysis helps travelers make cost-effective decisions and allows airlines to optimize pricing strategies for higher revenue. Future improvements could involve predictive modeling using machine learning to forecast flight fares based on real-time trends.
